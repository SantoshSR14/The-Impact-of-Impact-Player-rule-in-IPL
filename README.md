# The-Impact-of-Impact-Player-rule-in-IPL
This project deals with analyzing key trends that have changed in the IPL after introducing the Impact player rule. This analysis is built using Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib. The whole project is built using Jupyter Notebook.

The Impact player rule allows teams to substitute one player from a list of 5 named substitutes. The substitution can take place during the start of the innings, at the end of the over, during a batter's retirement or injury. Teams can submit different squads based on the toss decision-Batting 1st 11 and Bowling 1st 11.

The datasets used are data from the last two IPL seasons before introducing the Impact player rule (IPL 2021-22) and first two seasons of IPL after introducing the Impact player rule (IPL 2023-24).

üìÅ Datasets used: 
1. Kaggle-https://lnkd.in/gQ-A2GNS \n
2.Kaggle-https://lnkd.in/gQ4sw3dG \n
3.Kaggle-https://lnkd.in/gS4wtsmK \n

üîé Modules of this project:
1.Frequency of 200+ scores and 200+ successful chases
2.Count of boundaries (fours & sixes)
3.Toss success rate comparison
4.Occurrence of 12+ RPO in powerplays
5.Frequency of bowlers conceding 12+ RPO

üìå Key Insights:
1.The Impact Player rule has helped teams score/chase 200+ more often by adding depth to batting lineups.
2.There‚Äôs been a significant increase in boundaries post-2023.
3.Toss advantage has decreased, making matches more balanced.
4.Teams are now more aggressive in powerplays, frequently scoring 12+ RPO.
5.The rule has diminished the chasing advantage- Teams batting first are now winning more.
6.Bowlers are under pressure- A noticeable increase in high economy spells post-rule change.

Overall, the Impact player rule has made the IPL fast paced where teams are scoring and chasing scores at a brisk run rate and has made the competition tighter between the teams.
